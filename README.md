The accompanying Excel file contains time series of yearly global average near-surface air temperatures from 32 CMIP6 files, along with additional groupings of those 32 models using various methods of baseline removal (anomaly computation). Also given are the correlations of each year's temperature (or temperature anomaly) with the models' equilibrium climate sensitivity  (ECS) value.
